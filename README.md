This is is my first Capstone Project for Springboard called "Pinnacle Planner." It is deployed at https://schedule-app6.onrender.com. 
This app was designed to ease the process of scheduling physical therapy home health visits by allowing a patient to pick a time slot for their visit 
according to the clinician's availability. It uses a SQL database for patient information for the clinician's reference. The clinician or scheduler can 
add in new patient details and update patient information with specifics about a patient's preferred times and days of the week they would like to participate in 
treatment. The app utilizes Calendly's API to render the calender and provide the available time slots based on the availability in the clinician's Google calendar 
using Google's scopes. The app requires Google authorization to comply with HIPAA and keep patient details secure and confidential. The stack includes HTML, 
CSS, Python, Flask, Calendly API and Google API.
